## Additional Information
* In this project, I worked with GraphQL and Apollo for the very first time. At first I was confused as I wanted to approach fetching the data as I did with a Wordpress database. Fortunately, Apollo has great documentation and a big community that helped me to find the information I needed to create this app.
* FetchMore was used with updateQuery which is a deprecated callback. However, because I found more information of this callback as oppossed to the updated field policies and read and merge functions that the newest version suggests, I chose to work with updateQuery as I am still learning Apollo and later when I am more familiarized with this tool I will look into update this functionality.

## Technologies
* React (JS)
* JSX
* Styles: CSS
* API: GraphQL & Apollo
