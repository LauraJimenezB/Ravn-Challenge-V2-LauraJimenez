## Additional Information
* In this project, I work with GraphQL and Apollo for the very first time. At first I was confused as I wanted to approach fetching the data as I did with a Wordpress database. Fortunately, Apollo has great documentation and it was easy to look for the information I needed to create this app.

## Technologies
* React (JS)
* JSX
* Styles: CSS
* API: GraphQL & Apollo
